# MissNoMail

MissNoMail is an automated email filtering tool that extracts job and internship opportunities from your Gmail inbox and delivers them in a neatly organized digest.

## üéØ Motivation and Overview

**Are you someone who gets a lot of emails and spends time looking for the right ones?**

I do face this problem, beneath all the emails I receive daily there are emails related to internships/job opportunities and it's really easy to miss those. Most of them have an application deadline which can be easily missed if you don't check the email on time.

MissNoMail solves this problem of missing important career opportunities buried in your inbox. Using the Gmail API and Google's Gemini AI.

### üîç How does it work?

1. Scans your recent emails using the Gmail API. (default: past 1 day)
2. Intelligently filters and removes irrelevant emails based on email subject using a LLM.
3. Retrieves the full body contents of the remaining relevant emails.
4. Extracts structured information from each opportunity:
    - Company name
    - Position details
    - Application link
    - Deadline
    - Requirements
    - Other important info
5. Compiles everything into a clean, organized digest, a markdown-based email (plain text & HTML)
6. Delivers the digest directly to your inbox.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Smart Filtering:** Uses AI to identify job-related emails with high accuracy.
- **Structured Format:** Presents opportunities in a consistent, easy-to-read format.
